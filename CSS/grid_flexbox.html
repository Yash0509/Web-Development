        <p>I am <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mvtrASElk_pRhQ8mVlKEe6h_KC4P7-O3ccjN7sVGqKQ/edit">Yash</a> Kulkarni, a sophomore in Metallurgical Engineering and Materials Science (MEMS) department. Along with majoring in MEMS, I am also pursuing a minor in Computer Science and Engineering. Currently, I am a Category-1 Student with a CPI of 8.2 based on my academic performance until 2nd semester. Apart from my minor course in Computer Networks, I am also learning various softwares in Software Systems Lab as my Additional Learning course (ALC), where I have done hands-on programming in Python, SQL and Java. In my current semester, in Data Analysis and Interpretation course, I really enjoy doing Statistical Analysis for different problem statements using the R Programming language.

            My reason for applying for this project is twofold- first, it aligns with my interest in Computer Science and is a good extension to my current courses. Secondly, I find this problem statement intriguing because in today’s high-tech and competitive environment it is the prime requirement of all manufacturing facilities to maintain the highest level of uptime of their machines and equipments. I feel this project’s objective will help to identify and evaluate the reliability of assembly, and subassembly components and ensure a predictive maintenance schedule. I think this project use case will be helpful not only in manufacturing plants but also in facilities like hospitals, malls, hotels and many more.
